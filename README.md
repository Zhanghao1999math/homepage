## About me

I am a 5-th year PhD student at Tsinghua University, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center. Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-IJjsjcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [CV](Files/CV Hao Zhang.pdf).

##  Research Descriptions

I am interested in vertex operator algebras and their applications in conformal field theory. Recently, I proved the sewing-factorization theorem on finite logarithmic chiral CFTs with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io). 

My [slides](Files/2025 Orsay.pdf) at Université Paris-Saclay describe the relation between smooth and nodal conformal blocks in logarithmic CFT.

My [slides](Files/2025.Rocky.Mountain.pdf) at Rocky Mountain Representation Theory Seminar describe the relation between sewing-factorization theorem and coend.

Bin Gui's [slides](Files/2025_SJTU.pdf) at Université Paris-Saclay describe how pseudo-traces and (co)ends are related.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an e-mail.

> In this paper, under the C_2-cofinite condition, we prove that the pseudo-q-trace construction gives an isomorphism between the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks and the space of symmetric linear functionals of ![End](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb%20V}(\mathbb%20G)), where G is a projective generator of Mod(V). This is a conjecture by [Gainutdinov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azat-Gainutdinov-2)-[Runkel](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/runkel/). With the help of pseudotrace reciprocity in our previous paper, we prove this conjecture by showing that the end

> In this paper, we prove several equivalent versions of sewing-factorization theorem for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs. One of our versions takes the form of horizontal composition of profunctors—defined via coends—which aligns with the TQFT framework proposed in the paper [Modular Functors from Non-Semisimple 3D TFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18038) by [Hofer](https://aaron-hofer.github.io/)-[Runkel](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/runkel/). In particular, our result naturally connects with the topological modular functors in the sense of [Lyubashenko](https://imath.kiev.ua/~lub/) and [Fuchs](https://jfuchs.hotell.kau.se/gen/cont.html)-[Schweigert](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/).

> In this paper, we prove the higher genus convergence of sewing for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs, which aligns with the convergence of pseudo-q-traces in the sense of [Fiordalisi's work](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219199716500267?srsltid=AfmBOoosN_gHU5tzp39SWui_HZLo2ZwTg5lBDEV2yM7OyTQZyRgC10i7). This type of sewing is the correct one to build the sewing-factorization property.

> In this paper, we construct *higher genus (dual) fusion products* using propagation of partial conformal blocks. We also formulate the sewing-factorization theorem in terms of (dual) fusion products.
