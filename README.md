## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  PhD student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the interaction of mathematical objects (such as Lie theory, vertex operator algebra, tensor category, etc) with physics (such as topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, etc).

## Teaching Experience
- (2022 Spring) Teaching assistant for Calculus C(2)
- (2021 Fall) Teaching assistant for Linear Algebra

## Seminar
- (2022.1-2022.6) [TQFT seminar](https://github.com/Zhanghao1999math/homepage/files/8449221/TQFT_seminar.pdf)
> This is a reading seminar of topological quantum field theory at Tsinghua university. Please send me an e-mail if you are interested.
- (2021.2-2021.5) Infinite dimensional Lie algebras
> This is a reading seminar of Kac-Moody algebras at Nanjing University.
