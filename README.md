## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  PhD student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University. Advisor: Zhengwei Liu
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the interaction of mathematical objects (such as Lie theory, vertex operator algebra, tensor category, etc) with physics (such as topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, etc).

## What I am learning right now
- Vertex operator algebras and conformal blocks
> VOAs (vertex operator algebras) and conformal blocks are defined by mathematicians to describe 2d conformal field theory. I am now focusing on sewing and factorization properties of conformal blocks. I recommend two notes if you are interested:<br>
1, *Conformal Blocks: Vector Bundle Structures, Sewing, and Factorization* by Bin Gui;<br>
2, *Lectures on Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Blocks* by Bin Gui.

Both notes can be found in [Bin Gui's homepage](https://binguimath.github.io). Anyone who is interested in these topics is also welcome to discuss with me.

## Notes
- [Hodge theory and Serre duality](Files/Notes on Hodge theory.pdf)
> This note mainly covers Hodge theory on real or complex manifolds. With Hodge theory, we can interpret de Rham cohomology and Dolbeault cohomology as some kind of 'harmonic forms', which in particular gives the well-known Poincare and Serre duality.<br>
- [Cohomology theory of complex geometry](Files/Cohomology theory.pdf)
> This note mainly covers some basic tools to study cohomology theory of compact Riemann surface (or more generally, compact KÃ¤hler manifold), including Riemann-Roch theorem, Serre and Kodaira vanishing theorem.
