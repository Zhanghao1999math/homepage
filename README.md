## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  Ph.D student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University. Advisor: Zhengwei Liu
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I am interested in vertex operator algebras and their applications in conformal field theory. Recently, I am working on the conformal block theory for C_2 cofinite vertex operator algebras with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io).

## Publications
- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C_2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras I: Propagation and Dual Fusion Products, `arXiv:2305.10180` [Preprint](Files/2023 Dual fusion products.pdf)
- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C_2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-q-traces, [Preprint](Files/2024 Convergence.pdf)

## Notes
- [Hodge theory and Serre duality](Files/Notes on Hodge theory.pdf)
> This note mainly covers Hodge theory on real or complex manifolds. With Hodge theory, we can interpret de Rham cohomology and Dolbeault cohomology as some kind of 'harmonic forms', which in particular gives the well-known Poincare and Serre duality.<br>
- [Cohomology theory of complex geometry](Files/Cohomology theory.pdf)
> This note mainly covers some basic tools to study cohomology theory of compact Riemann surface (or more generally, compact KÃ¤hler manifold), including Riemann-Roch theorem, Serre and Kodaira vanishing theorem.
