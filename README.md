## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  PhD student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the interaction of mathematical objects (such as Lie theory, vertex operator algebra, tensor category, etc) with physics (such as topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, etc).

## What I am learning right now
I am learning three different topics right now:<br>
- Vertex operator algebras and conformal blocks
> I am learning this topic from the [course](https://binguimath.github.io/Course_2022_VOA.html)
- Topological quantum field theory
- KZ equation

## Seminar
- (2022.1-2022.6) [Topological quantum field theory](https://github.com/Zhanghao1999math/homepage/files/8449221/TQFT_seminar.pdf)
> This is a reading seminar of topological quantum field theory at Tsinghua university. Please send me an e-mail if you are interested.<br>

- (2021.2-2021.5) Infinite dimensional Lie algebras
> This is a reading seminar of Kac-Moody algebras at Nanjing University. We mainly talked about:<br>
(1) The general theory of Kac-Moody algebras, including the classification, root systems, Weyl groups and representation theory.<br>
(2) Realization of affine Kac-Moody algebras by central extension of loop algebras.<br>
(3) Structure and representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras.<br>

- (2020.9-2020.12) Representation theory
> This is a reading seminar of representation theory of classical semisimple Lie algebras at Nanjing University.<br>
Reference: Fulton & Harris. Representation theory, a first course.
