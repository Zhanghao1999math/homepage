## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  Ph.D student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University. Advisor: Zhengwei Liu
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I am interested in vertex operator algebras and their applications in conformal field theory. Recently, I am working on the conformal block theory for C_2 cofinite vertex operator algebras with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io).

## Publications
- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C_2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras I: Propagation and Dual Fusion Products, `arXiv:2305.10180` [Preprint](Files/2023 Dual fusion products.pdf)
- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C_2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-q-traces, `arXiv:2411.07707` [Preprint](Files/2024 Convergence.pdf)
