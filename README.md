## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  PhD student, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University. Advisor: Zhengwei Liu
- (2017.9-2021.6) B.S., Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University


##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the interaction of mathematical objects (such as Lie theory, vertex operator algebra, tensor category, etc) with physics (such as topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, etc).

## What I am learning right now
I am learning three different topics right now:<br>
- Vertex operator algebras and conformal blocks
> According to Segal's picture, VOA (vertex operator algebras) and conformal blocks comes from 2 dimensional chiral CFT (conformal field theory) in a natural way. Mathematicans do the opposite: construct CFT from VOA and conformal blocks obtained in a different way. I am learning this topic from the [course](https://binguimath.github.io/Course_2022_VOA.html).
- Complex Geometry
> I am learning complex geometry in order to understand factorization property of conformal blocks.

Anyone who is interested in these topics is welcome to discuss with me.

## Notes
- Notes on complex geometry
> (1) [Hodge theory and Serre duality](https://github.com/Zhanghao1999math/homepage/files/9002714/Notes.on.Hodge.theory.pdf)
This note mainly covers Hodge theory on real or complex manifolds. With Hodge theory, we can interpret de Rham cohomology and Dolbeault cohomology as some kind of 'harmonic forms', which in particular gives the well-known Serre duality.<br>
(2)Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem and Kodaira vanishing theorem (in preparation)

## Seminars
- (2022.1-2022.6) [Topological quantum field theory](https://github.com/Zhanghao1999math/homepage/files/8449221/TQFT_seminar.pdf)
> This is a reading seminar of topological quantum field theory at Tsinghua university. Please send me an e-mail if you are interested.<br>

- (2021.2-2021.5) Infinite dimensional Lie algebras
> This is a reading seminar of Kac-Moody algebras at Nanjing University. We mainly talked about:<br>
(1) The general theory of Kac-Moody algebras, including the classification, root systems, Weyl groups and representation theory.<br>
(2) Realization of affine Kac-Moody algebras by central extension of loop algebras.<br>
(3) Structure and representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras.<br>
