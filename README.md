##  Research Descriptions

I am interested in vertex operator algebras and their applications in conformal field theory. Recently, I proved the sewing-factorization theorem on finite logarithmic chiral CFTs with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io). 

My [SLIDES](Files/2025.Rocky.Mountain.pdf) at Rocky Mountain Representation Theory Seminar describe the relation between sewing-factorization theorem and coend.

Bin Gui's [SLIDES](Files/2025_SJTU.pdf) at SJTU describe the relation between sewing-factorization theorem and pseudo-traces.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an e-mail.


## Publications

- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Associative Algebras and the Ends of Vertex Operator Algebras, to appear soon
> In this paper, we prove that the pseudo-q-trace construction gives an isomorphism between the space of torus conformal blocks and the space of symmetric linear functionals of the endomorphism algebra of a projective generator. This is a conjecture by [Gainutdinov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azat-Gainutdinov-2)-[Runkel](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/runkel/). We prove this conjecture by showing that Lyubashenko's end is an AUF algebra and constructing a linear isomorphism between Mod(V) and the category of coherent left module of this AUF algebra.

- (Joint with [Bin Gui](https://binguimath.github.io)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C_2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems, `arXiv:2503.23995` [Preprint](Files/2025 SF theorem.pdf)
> In this paper, we prove several equivalent versions of sewing-factorization theorem for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs. One of our versions takes the form of horizontal composition of profunctors—defined via coends—which aligns with the framework proposed in the paper [Modular Functors from Non-Semisimple 3D TFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18038) by [Hofer](https://aaron-hofer.github.io/)-[Runkel](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/runkel/). In particular, our result naturally connects with the topological modular functors in the sense of [Lyubashenko](https://imath.kiev.ua/~lub/) and [Fuchs](https://jfuchs.hotell.kau.se/gen/cont.html)-[Schweigert](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/).

> In this paper, we prove the convergence of sewing conformal blocks for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs, which aligns with the convergence of pseudo-q-traces in the sense of [Fiordalisi's work](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219199716500267?srsltid=AfmBOoosN_gHU5tzp39SWui_HZLo2ZwTg5lBDEV2yM7OyTQZyRgC10i7).

> In this paper, we construct higher genus (dual) fusion products using propagation of partial conformal blocks. We also formulate the sewing-factorization theorem in terms of (dual) fusion products.
